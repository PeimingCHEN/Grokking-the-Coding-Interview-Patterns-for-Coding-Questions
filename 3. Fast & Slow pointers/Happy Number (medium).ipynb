    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Any number will be called a happy number if, after repeatedly replacing it with a number equal to the sum of the square of all of its digits, leads us to number '1'. All other (not-happy) numbers will never reach '1'. Instead, they will be stuck in a cycle of numbers which does not include '1'.<br>\n",

    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: 23<br>\n",
    "**Output**: true (23 is a happy number)  \n",

    "1. $2^2+3^2=4+9=13$\n",
    "2. $1^2+3^2=1+9=10$\n",

    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**: 12<br>\n",
    "**Output**: false (12 is not a happy number)<br>\n",
    "**Explanations**: \n",
    "1. $1^2 + 2^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$\n",
    "2. $5^2 = 25$\n",
    "3. $2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 = 29$\n",

    "Step '13' leads us back to step '5' as the number becomes equal to '89', this means that we can never reach '1', therefore, '12' is not a happy number."
