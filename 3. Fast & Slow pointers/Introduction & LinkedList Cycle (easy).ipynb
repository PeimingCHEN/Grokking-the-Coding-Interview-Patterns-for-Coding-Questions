    "### Solution\n",
    "Use a slow and fast pointer to traverse the LinkedList. In each iteration, the slow pointer moves one step and the fast pointer moves two steps. then\n",
    "1. If the LinkedList doesnâ€™t have a cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the LinkedList before the slow pointer and the slow pointer will never catch up to the fast pointer.\n",
    "2. If the LinkedList has a cycle, the fast pointer enters the cycle first, followed by the slow pointer. If the two pointers can meet, there are two possibilities for the fast pointer is approaching the slow pointer: the fast pointer is one step behind the slow pointer or two steps.<br>\n",
    "All other distances between the fast and slow pointers will reduce to one of these two possibilities. Analyze the above scenarios:\n",
    "* 1. If the fast pointer is one step behind the slow pointer: The fast pointer moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step, and they both meet.\n",
    "* 2. If the fast pointer is two steps behind the slow pointer: The fast pointer moves two steps and the slow pointer moves one step. After the moves, the fast pointer will be one step behind the slow pointer, which reduces this scenario to the first scenario. This means that the two pointers will meet in the next iteration."
