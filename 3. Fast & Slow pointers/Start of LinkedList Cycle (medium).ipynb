    "Given the head of a **Singly LinkedList** that contains a cycle, write a function to find the **starting node of the cycle**.<br>\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "Find the length of the LinkedList cycle to find the start.\n",
    "1. Take two pointers (pointer1 and pointer2) to point to the start of the LinkedList.\n",
    "2. Find the length of the LinkedList cycle like LinkedList Cycle. Assumae the length of cycle is 'K' nodes.\n",
    "3. Move pointer2 ahead by 'K' nodes.\n",
    "4. Keep incrementing pointer1 and pointer2 until they both meet.\n",
    "5. As pointer2 is 'K' nodes ahead of pointer1, which means, pointer2 must have completed one loop in the cycle when both pointers meet. Their meeting point will be the start of the cycle."
