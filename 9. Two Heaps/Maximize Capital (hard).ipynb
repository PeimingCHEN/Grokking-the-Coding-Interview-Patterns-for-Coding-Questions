    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a set of investment projects with their respective profits, we need to find the most profitable projects. We are given an initial capital and are allowed to invest only in a fixed number of projects. Our goal is to choose projects that give us the maximum profit. Write a function that returns the maximum total capital after selecting the most profitable projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital. Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our capital.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: Project Capitals=[0,1,2], Project Profits=[1,2,3], Initial Capital=1, Number of Projects=2<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 6<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "With initial capital of ‘1’, we will start the second project which will give us profit of ‘2’. Once we selected our first project, our total capital will become 3 (profit + initial capital).<br>\n",
    "With ‘3’ capital, we will select the third project, which will give us ‘3’ profit.<br>\n",
    "After the completion of the two projects, our total capital will be 6 (1+2+3).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**: Project Capitals=[0,1,2,3], Project Profits=[1,2,3,5], Initial Capital=0, Number of Projects=3<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 8<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**:\n",
    "With ‘0’ capital, we can only select the first project, bringing out capital to 1.<br>\n",
    "Next, we will select the second project, which will bring our capital to 3.<br>\n",
    "Next, we will select the fourth project, giving us a profit of 5.<br>\n",
    "After selecting the three projects, our total capital will be 8 (1+2+5)."

    "### Solution\n",
    "While selecting projects we have two constraints:<br>\n",
    "1. We can select a project only when we have the required capital.\n",
    "2. There is a maximum limit on how many projects we can select.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we don’t have any constraint on time, we should choose a project, among the projects for which we have enough capital, which gives us a maximum profit. Following this **greedy** approach will give us the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "While selecting a project, we will do two things:\n",
    "1. Find all the projects that we can choose with the available capital.\n",
    "2. From the list of projects in the 1st step, choose the project that gives us a maximum profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the Two Heaps approach:\n",
    "1. Add all project capitals to a min-heap, so that we can select a project with the smallest capital requirement.\n",
    "2. Go through the top projects of the min-heap and filter the projects that can be completed within our available capital. Insert the profits of all these projects into a max-heap, so that we can choose a project with the maximum profit.\n",
    "3. Finally, select the top project of the max-heap for investment.\n",
    "4. Repeat the 2nd and 3rd steps for the required number of projects."
