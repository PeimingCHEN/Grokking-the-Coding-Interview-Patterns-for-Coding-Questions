    "Given a binary tree and a number 'S', find all paths from root-to-leaf such that the sum of all the node values of each path equals 'S'.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [113. Path Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)\n",

    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22<br>\n",
    "**Output**: [[5,4,11,2],[5,8,4,5]]<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: There are two paths whose sum equals targetSum:\n",

    "Two differences from Binary Tree Path Sum pattern:\n",
    "1. Every time we find a root-to-leaf path, we will store it in a list.\n",
    "2. We will traverse all paths and will not stop processing after finding the first path."

    "If we consider the allPaths arraym, there exists only one path to reach any leaf node, we can easily say that total root-to-leaf paths in a binary tree can’t be more than the number of leaves. As we know that there can’t be more than $(N+1)/2$ leaves in a binary tree, therefore the maximum number of elements in allPaths will be $O((N+1)/2) = O(N)$. Now, each of these paths can have many nodes in them. For a balanced binary tree, each leaf node will be at maximum depth. As we know that the depth (or height) of a balanced binary tree is $O(logN)$ we can say that, at the most, each path can have $log(N)$ nodes in it. This means that the total size of the allPaths list will be $O(N*logN)$. If the tree is not balanced, we will still have the same worst-case space complexity.\n",
