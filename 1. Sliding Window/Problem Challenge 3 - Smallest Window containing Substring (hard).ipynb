    "Given a string and a pattern, find the **smallest substring** in the given string which has **all the character occurrences of the given pattern**.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"aabdec\", Pattern=\"abc\"<br>\n",
    "**Output**: \"abdec\"<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: The smallest substring having all characters of the pattern is \"abdec\"<br>\n",

    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"aabdec\", Pattern=\"abac\"<br>\n",
    "**Output**: \"aabdec\"<br>\n",

    "**Output**: \"bca\"<br>\n",

    "##### Example 4\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"adcad\", Pattern=\"abc\"<br>\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "Has one difference with Problem Challenge 1: find a substring having all characters of the pattern which means that the required substring can have some additional characters and doesnâ€™t need to be a permutation of the pattern. <br>\n",
    "1. Counting every matching instance of a character. <br>\n",
    "2. Whenever all the characters are matched, shrink the window from the beginning to find the smallest substring. <br>\n",
    "3. Stop shrink as soon as we remove a matched character from the sliding window. <br>\n",
    "**Attention**: We could have redundant matching characters, e.g., we might have two 'a in the sliding window when we only need one 'a'. In that case, when we encounter the first 'a', we will simply shrink the window without decrementing the matched count. We will decrement the matched count when the second 'a' goes out of the window."
