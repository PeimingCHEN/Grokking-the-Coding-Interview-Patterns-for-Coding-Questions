    "### Solution\n",
    "Use a HashMap to count the frequency of each letter.\n",
    "1. Iterate through the string to add one letter at a time in the window. <br>\n",
    "2. Keep track of the count of the maximum repeating letter in any window (maxRepeatLetterCount).<br>\n",
    "3. So, at any time, we have a window with one letter repeating maxRepeatLetterCount times; this means we should try to replace the remaining letters.<br>\n",
    "If the remaining letters are less than or equal to k, we can replace them all.<br>\n",
    "If we have more than k remaining letters, we should shrink the window as we cannot replace more than k letters.<br>\n",
    "4. While shrinking the window, we don’t need to update maxRepeatLetterCount. Since we are only interested in the longest valid substring, our sliding windows do not have to shrink, even if a window may cover an invalid substring. Either we expand the window by appending a character to the right or we shift the entire window to the right by one. We only expand the window when the frequency of the newly added character exceeds the historical maximum frequency.<br>"
