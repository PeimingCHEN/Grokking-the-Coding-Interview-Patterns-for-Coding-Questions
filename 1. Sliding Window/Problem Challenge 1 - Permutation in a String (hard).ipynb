    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a string and a pattern, find out if the **string contains any permutation of the pattern**. <br>\n",
    "Permutation is defined as the re-arranging of the characters of the string. For example, \"abc\" has the following six permutations:<br>\n",
    "*abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba* <br>\n",
    "If a string has 'n' distinct characters, it will have $n!$ permutations.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [567. Permutation in String](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"oidbcaf\", Pattern=\"abc\"  <br>\n",
    "**Output**: true <br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: The string contains \"bca\" which is a permutation of the given pattern. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"odicf\", Pattern=\"dc\" <br>\n",
    "**Output**: false <br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: No permutation of the pattern is present in the given string as a substring. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 3\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"bcdxabcdy\", Pattern=\"bcdyabcdx\" <br>\n",
    "**Output**: true <br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Both the string and the pattern are a permutation of each other. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 4\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"aaacb\", Pattern=\"abc\" <br>\n",
    "**Output**: true <br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: The string contains \"acb\" which is a permutation of the given pattern. <br>"

    "Use a **HashMap** to remember the frequencies of all characters in the given pattern. Our goal will be to match all the characters from this HashMap with a sliding window in the given string.<br>\n",
    "1. Create a HashMap to calculate the frequencies of all characters in the pattern.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the string, adding one character at a time in the sliding window.\n",
