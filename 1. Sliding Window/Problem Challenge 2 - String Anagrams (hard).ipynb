    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a string and a pattern, find **all anagrams of the pattern in the given string**. <br>\n",
    "Every anagram is a permutation of a string. As we know, when we are **not allowed to repeat characters** while finding permutations of a string, we get $N!$ permutations (or anagrams) of a string having $N$ characters. For example, here are the six anagrams of the string \"abc\":<br>\n",
    "*abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba* <br>\n",
    "Write a function to return a list of starting indices of the anagrams of the pattern in the given string.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"ppqp\", Pattern=\"pq\"  <br>\n",
    "**Output**: [1, 2] <br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: The two anagrams of the pattern in the given string are \"pq\" and \"qp\". <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**: String=\"abbcabc\", Pattern=\"abc\" <br>\n",
    "**Output**: [2, 3, 4] <br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: The three anagrams of the pattern in the given string are \"bca\", \"cab\", and \"abc\". <br>"

    "### Solution\n",
    "Use a **HashMap** to remember the frequencies of all characters in the given pattern. Our goal will be to match all the characters from this HashMap with a sliding window in the given string.<br>\n",
    "1. Create a HashMap to calculate the frequencies of all characters in the pattern.\n",
    "2. Iterate through the string, adding one character at a time in the sliding window.\n",
    "3. If the character being added matches a character in the HashMap, decrement its frequency in the map. If the character frequency becomes zero, we got a complete match.\n",
    "4. Find every occurrence of any permutation of the pattern in the string. (**Different from Problem Challenge 1**)\n",
    "5. If the window size is greater than the length of the pattern, shrink the window to make it equal to the patternâ€™s size. At the same time, if the character going out was part of the pattern, put it back in the frequency HashMap."
