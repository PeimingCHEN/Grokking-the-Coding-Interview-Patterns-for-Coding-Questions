    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Given a list of intervals representing the start and end time of 'N' meetings, find the **minimum number of rooms** required to **hold all the meetings**.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [253. Meeting Rooms II](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-ii/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Meetings**: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 2<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, we need two rooms to hold these two meetings. [7,9] can occur in any of the two rooms later.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Meetings**: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 1<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: None of the meetings overlap, therefore we only need one room to hold all meetings.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 3\n",
    "**Meetings**: [[1,4], [2,3], [3,6]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**:2<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Since [1,4] overlaps with the other two meetings [2,3] and [3,6], we need two rooms to hold all the meetings.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 4\n",
    "**Meetings**: [[4,5], [2,3], [2,4], [3,5]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 2<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: We will need one room for [2,3] and [3,5], and another room for [2,4] and [4,5]."

    "### Solution\n",
    "Keeping track of the mutual exclusiveness of the overlapping meetings means **keeping track of the ending time of all the meetings currently happening**. A **Min Heap** would fit our requirements best.<br>\n",
    "1. Sort all the meetings on their start time.\n",
    "2. Create a min-heap to store all the active meetings. This min-heap will also be used to find the active meeting with the smallest end time.\n",
    "3. Iterate through all the meetings one by one to add them to the min-heap. Let’s say we are trying to schedule the meeting *m1*.\n",
    "4. Since the min-heap contains all the active meetings, before scheduling *m1* we can remove all meetings from the heap that has ended before *m1*, i.e., remove all meetings from the heap that have an end time smaller than or equal to the start time of *m1*.\n",
    "5. Now add *m1* to the heap.\n",
    "6. The heap will always have all the overlapping meetings, so we will need rooms for all of them. Keep a counter to remember the maximum size of the heap at any time which will be the minimum number of rooms needed.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips for minHeap**: minHeap will sort all elements from small to big according to the first number of the array. E.g. [[4,6][2,7]] will be sorted automatically to [[2,7], [4,6]], because $2<4$"
