    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "For 'K' employees, we are given a list of intervals representing the working hours of each employee. Our goal is to find out if there is a **free interval that is common to all employees**. You can assume that each list of employee working hours is sorted on the start time.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [5,6]], [[2,3], [6,8]]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: [3,5]<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Both the employees are free between [3,5].<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Input**: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3], [9,12]], [[2,4]], [[6,8]]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: [4,6], [8,9]<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: All employees are free between [4,6] and [8,9].<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 3\n",
    "**Input**: Employee Working Hours=[[[1,3]], [[2,4]], [[3,5], [7,9]]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: [5,7]<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: All employees are free between [5,7].<br>"

    "### Solution\n",
    "One simple solution can be to put all employees' working hours in a list and sort them on the start time. Then we can iterate through the list to find the gaps. This algorithm will take $O(N * logN)$ time for sorting all the intervals. The space complexity will be $O(N)$ for sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using a Heap to Sort the Intervals**\n",
    "\n",
    "One fact that we are not utilizing is that each employee list is individually sorted!\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the first interval of each employee and insert it in a Min Heap. This Min Heap can always give us the interval with the smallest start time. Once we have the smallest start-time interval, we can then compare it with the next smallest start-time interval (again from the Heap) to find the gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we take an interval out of the Min Heap, we can insert the same employeeâ€™s next interval. This also means that we need to know which interval belongs to which employee."
