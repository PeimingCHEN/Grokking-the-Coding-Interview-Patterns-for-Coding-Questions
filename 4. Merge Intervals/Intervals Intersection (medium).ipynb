    "Given two lists of intervals, find the **intersection of these two lists**. Each list consists of **disjoint intervals sorted on their start time**.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [986. Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)\n",

    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Input**: arr1=[[1, 3], [5, 6], [7, 9]], arr2=[[2, 3], [5, 7]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: [2, 3], [5, 6], [7, 7]<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: The output list contains the common intervals between the two lists.<br>\n",

    "### Solution\n",
    "whenever the two intervals overlap, one of the intervalâ€™s start lies within the other interval.<br>\n",
    "the overlapping interval is equal to: start = max(a.start, b.start) and end = min(a.end, b.end) <br>\n",
    "So our algorithm will be to iterate through both the lists together to see if any two intervals overlap. If two intervals overlap, we will insert the overlapped part into a result list and move on to the next interval which is finishing early."
