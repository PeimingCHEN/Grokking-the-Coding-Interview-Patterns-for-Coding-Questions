    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, and a CPU load when it is running. Our goal is to find the **maximum CPU load** at any time if all the **jobs are running on the same machine**.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [Find Max Bandwidth](https://leetcode.com/discuss/interview-question/algorithms/124554/Find-Max-Bandwidth)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Jobs**: [[1,4,3], [2,5,4], [7,9,6]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 7<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Since [1,4,3] and [2,5,4] overlap, their maximum CPU load (3+4=7) will be when both the jobs are running at the same time i.e., during the time interval (2,4).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Jobs**: [[6,7,10], [2,4,11], [8,12,15]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 15<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: None of the jobs overlap, therefore we will take the maximum load of any job which is 15.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 3\n",
    "**Jobs**: [[1,4,2], [2,4,1], [3,6,5]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: 8<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Maximum CPU load will be 8 as all jobs overlap during the time interval [3,4].<br>"

    "The problem follows the Merge Interval pattern and can be converted to Minimum Meeting Rooms, which trying to find the maximum number of meetings happening at any time. We will need to keep a running count of the maximum CPU load at any time to find the overall maximum load."
