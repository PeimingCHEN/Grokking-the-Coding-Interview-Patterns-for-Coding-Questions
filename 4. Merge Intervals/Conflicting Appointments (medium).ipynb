    "Given an array of intervals representing 'N' appointments, find out if a person can **attend all the appointments**.<br>\n",
    "Leetcode: [252. Meeting Rooms](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms/)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example 1\n",
    "**Appointments**: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: false<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.<br>\n",

    "##### Example 2\n",
    "**Appointments**: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: true<br>\n",
    "**Explanation**: None of the appointments overlap, therefore a person can attend all of them.<br>\n",

    "##### Example 3\n",
    "**Appointments**: [[4,5], [2,3], [3,6]]<br>\n",
    "**Output**: false<br>\n",
