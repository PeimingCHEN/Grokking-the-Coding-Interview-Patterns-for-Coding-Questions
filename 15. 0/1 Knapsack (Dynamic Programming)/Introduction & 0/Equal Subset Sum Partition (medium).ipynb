Since we need to store the results for every subset and for every possible sum, therefore we will be using a two-dimensional array to store the results of the solved sub-problems. The first dimension of the array will represent different subsets and the second dimension will represent different ‘sums’ that we can calculate from each subset. These two dimensions of the array can also be inferred from the two changing values (sum and currentIndex) in our recursive function *canPartitionRecursive()*."
