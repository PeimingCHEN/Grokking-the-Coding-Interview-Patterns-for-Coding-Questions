    "Let’s assume ‘S’ represents the total sum of all the numbers. So, in this problem, we are trying to find a subset whose sum is as close to ‘S/2’ as possible, because if we can partition the given set into two subsets of an equal sum, we get the minimum difference, i.e. zero. This transforms our problem to Subset Sum, where we try to find a subset whose sum is equal to a given number-- ‘S/2’ in our case. If we can’t find such a subset, then we will take the subset which has the sum closest to ‘S/2’. This is easily possible, as we will be calculating all possible sums with every subset.\n",
